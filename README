Using MySQL as DB, tests written in Gherkin (cucumber framework) in src/test/resources/feature folder
for each one of the use cases:
file student_registration.feature for positive ("happy path") cases
file student_registration_error_handling.feature for use cases generating errors (ie. providing student or course names
for unexisting entities, negative score values...)

DDL is in src/test/resources/ddl/init.sql (used in cucumber tests to initialize)

All sections (1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5) implemented and tested.
For 2.4 the "score" is a new column of the Entity CourseRegistration.
In section 2.5, I added a new method in StudentRepository annotated with @Query. This @Query selects all students whose ids
are not in a sub select query. This "sub select" queries all student ids whose course registrations' course name is equal to the course name provided:

Select s from Student where s.id not int (select s2.id from Student s2 INNER JOIN s2.courseRegistrations r INNER JOIN r.course as c where upper(c.name)=upper(?1))
