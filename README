Using MySQL as DB, tests written in Gherkin (cucumber framework) for each one of the use cases (file
student_registration.feature in src/test/resources/feature folder).

DDL is in src/test/resources/ddl/init.sql (used in cucumber tests to initialize)

Not all use cases were actually implemented, I did TDD and wrote failing tests before any implementation.
Section 1 and 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 implemented and tested. For 2.4 the "score"
is a new column of the Entity CourseRegistration.
As for 2.5, I'd add a new method in StudentRepository annotated with @Query. This @Query would select all students whose ids
were not in a sub select query. This "sub select" would query all student ids whose course registrations' course name are equal to the course name provided:

"Select s from Student where s.id not int (select s2.id from Student s2 INNER JOIN s2.courseRegistrations r INNER JOIN r.course as c where upper(c.name)=upper(?1))
